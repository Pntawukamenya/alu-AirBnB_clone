This is a clone of the Airbnb website. This project will be a basic server clone of the original AirBnB website. However, the cloned website will implement both the client side (front-end) and the server side (APIs, database, etc.).

Only the console or command interpreter will be used to implement this present project.

## Command Interpreter üñ•Ô∏è
The console works similarly to a shell but with constraints customized¬†to certain use conditions. Its function is to run commands against project objects. These instructions cover a variety of actions, such as:

Creating a new item, such as¬†a user or a place.
retrieving an item from sources such as files or databases.
Performing operations on objects, such as counting and calculating statistics.
Changing the characteristics of an item.
Removing an Object
Exiting the interpreter.
