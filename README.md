## AirBnB clone - The console
At the end of this project, anyone can understand, without the help of Google:



 After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

* A database or files that store data (data = objects)

* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

##Project Summary
This is a clone of the Airbnb website. This project will be a basic server clone of the original AirBnB website. However, the cloned website will implement both the client side (front-end) and the server side (APIs, database, etc.).

Only the console or command interpreter will be used to implement this present project.

## Command Interpreter üñ•Ô∏è
The console works similarly to a shell but with constraints customized¬†to certain use conditions. Its function is to run commands against project objects. These instructions cover a variety of actions, such as:

Creating a new item, such as¬†a user or a place.
retrieving an item from sources such as files or databases.
Performing operations on objects, such as counting and calculating statistics.
Changing the characteristics of an item.
Removing an Object
Exiting the interpreter.
